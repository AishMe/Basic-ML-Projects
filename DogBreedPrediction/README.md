# Dog Breed Prediction

### Description: 

This application utilizes a simple CNN model to predict the breed of a dog from an uploaded image. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, originally contained over 50 dog breed classes. To reduce computational complexity, the dataset was refined to focus on the top 3 breeds. After training the model for 100 epochs, it achieved a test accuracy of 78%. The model was then deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to upload an image of a dog and receive almost instant and accurate breed predictions.
